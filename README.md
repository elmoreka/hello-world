# hello-world

This is a repository to test git hub functionality of pushing and pulling.

My name is Karl Elmore. I was a computer consultant in the past, but left the industry. I have re-educated myself to return to the IT industry and my passion.

I just pulled this repository to my local drive, created this edit, will save and push back to github.
